# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

It is an exercise in putting together what we've learnt so far during the AiCore course.

The core code of the game is held within a class.

An instance of this class is called to start a new round of the game.
